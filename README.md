### An Experimental framework for oil and gas data validation and quality assurance

1.	Objective

No data analyzing project comes error free if we want to talk about the datasets. In this work we put together a framework for Data Validation and Preparing which is not case dependent. By using the open source tools to help us formulate data quality rules and combining that with the best practices of data cleansing, outlier detection and data validation. The goal of this paper is to explain the different aspects of data validation and profiling process and how it is domain dependent but in the same time several stages and levels of the process can be generalized to be valid for all domains. We will also take a walkthrough using a real dataset from Oil and Gas industries and by using one of the open source tools to help us perform out data quality checks.
